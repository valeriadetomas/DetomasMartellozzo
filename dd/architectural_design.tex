\subsection{High-level components and their interaction}
In the following section is provided an high view of the architecture of the system, that is structured following the three logic layer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer (P)}: The presentation tier is the user interface and communication layer of the application, where the end user interacts with the application. Its main purpose is to display information to and collect information from the user. This top-level tier can run on a web browser, as desktop application, or a graphical user interface (GUI), for example. \\Web presentation tiers are usually developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Desktop applications can be written in a variety of languages depending on the platform.
    \item \textbf{Business Logic or Application Layer(L)}: The application tier is the heart of the application. In this tier, information collected in the presentation tier is processed - sometimes against other information in the data tier - using business logic, a specific set of business rules. The application tier can also add, delete or modify data in the data tier.\\ The application tier is typically developed using Python, Java, Perl, PHP or Ruby, and communicates with the data tier using API calls. 
    \item \textbf{Data Layer (D)}: The data tier, sometimes called database tier, data access tier or back-end, is where the information processed by the application is stored and managed. This can be a relational database management system such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, Informix or Microsoft SQL Server, or in a NoSQL Database server such as Cassandra, CouchDB or MongoDB. 
\end{itemize}

In this case the system is a distributed application that follows the client-server paradigm: it is a two-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation and a data tier. the business logic lives in the data tier only.
In a two-tier application, all communication goes through the application tier. The presentation tier and the data tier cannot communicate directly with one another. 

Client and server are being allocated into different physical machines and their communication takes place via other components and interfaces, located in the middle of the structure and composed by hardware and software modules. 
The client is a Web Application, with is by definition a thin client, because of its total dependency from the server; so it only contains the presentation layer.
