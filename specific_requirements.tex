\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
qui ci vanno tutti i mockups con descrizione

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The application does not need any specific hardware requirements. 

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The web app requires a computer with a web browser installed and connected to 
The system has to rely on a DBMS API. It allows the management of all the data the system 
needs in order to provide its functionalities, described in subsection ~\ref{subsection:2.2}.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
All the communications between users and Dream website are made via HTTPS.

\subsubsection{Traceability Matrix}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The system serves its user with a web application. All the computations will take place on the server side, 
thus the app is meant to be lightweighted. Moreover the load in the night is expected to be really low.
There are no problems about reliability. The insertion of new data requires a quick response in order to store 
it in the system.

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
The only standard that needs to be highlighted here is the interaction with the database. It is important that the information are stored 
in a standardized form. In such manner, it is easier to memorize and retrieve data.


\subsubsection{Any Other Constraints}
Interaction between Dream and users needs to consider also regulatory policies.
As a matter of fact the application asks and retrieves data of each farmer.
More information about security and privacy will be provided in the section~\ref{subsubsection:3.4.3}


\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must prevent any failure in order to guarantee continuity. 
Simultaneous accesses are expected to work, especially in the afternoon when users are expectd to insrt and retrieve more information.

\subsubsection{Availability}
It is expected that the system has the lowest downtime possible. 
The system is available with a minimum time of 96\%, 
so that it about 14 days a year of downtime are allowed.


\subsubsection{Security}
\label{subsubsection:3.4.3}
Security of the data and of the communication user-system is a primary concern. Users credential are stored in a data base, so the system crypt the password data before store it. The system recognises the right type of user during the log in phase to ensure providing the correct level visibility of the data and the permission to update them or not. In this way farmerâ€™s privacy is guaranteed. As a matter of fact a farmer canâ€™t see another farmerâ€™s page.


\subsubsection{Maintanability}
The web application requires ordinary maintenance for improvements and in order to fix potential bugs. 
It is going to be scheduled at local night time, when user traffic is the lowest.
Moreover the system must be designed in a way that allows future addition of features.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The system as a web application must run on different software system as Windows, Linux an macOS.
On the server side is crucial focusing on the interaction between APIs and the data base to insert, update or read data.
